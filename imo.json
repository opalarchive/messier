        "statement": "The Bank of Bath issues coins with an $H$ on one side and a $T$ on the other. Harry has $n$ of these coins arranged in a line from left to right. He repeatedly performs the following operation: if there are exactly $k>0$ coins showing $H$, then he turns over the $k$th coin from the left; otherwise, all coins show $T$ and he stops. For example, if $n=3$ the process starting with the configuration $THT$ would be $THT \\to HHT  \\to HTT \\to TTT$, which stops after three operations.\\begin{enumerate}[label=(\\alph*)]\\item Show that, for each initial configuration, Harry stops after a finite number of operations.\\item For each initial configuration $C$, let $L(C)$ be the number of operations before Harry stops. For example, $L(THT) = 3$ and $L(TTT) = 0$.\\end{enumerate} Determine the average value of $L(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations $C$.",
